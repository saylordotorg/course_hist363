**Unit 1: Industrialization and Theories of Economic Change** <span
id="1"></span> 
*In the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, the world economy embarked on a
rapid process of change. During this Industrial Revolution, new
technologies greatly magnified the productivity of workers, while fossil
fuels pushed manufacturing and transportation systems far beyond the
natural limits of human and animal power. As these advances drove the
cost of industrial production down, consumption of manufactured goods
skyrocketed around the world. By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century,
nearly every society on Earth had been affected by the arrival of new
products, new means of transportation, new weapons, and new ideas.
Scholars have tried to explain the causes of this great transformation
since it began. *  
    
 *This unit will explain what industrialization is and provide a brief
overview of what the Industrial Revolution was and how it revolutionized
people’s lives. We will then study different interpretations of economic
theory that attempted to account for these dramatic changes, beginning
with pre-industrial theories and culminating with current perspectives
on the global economy.*
