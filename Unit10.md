**Unit 10: Globalization and the Industrialization in the Late 20th
Century** <span id="10"></span> 
*The second half of the twentieth century saw many changes in the
pattern of industrialization.  While the capitalist states of the West
enjoyed two decades of prosperity after 1945, problems in the global
economy led to stagnation and decline in many manufacturing sectors in
the 1960s and 1970s.  Manufacturing power shifted from the West to the
East, beginning with the reindustrialization of Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan.  Light and then heavy manufacturing moved to Asian production
sites, as the cost of labor in the West rose.  Southeast Asian states
and then communist China entered the market as low-cost producers in the
late 1970s and 1980s as previous barriers to international trade were
eliminated.  By the 1990s, free trade had replaced protectionism as the
dominant economic ideology in the industrialized world, creating new
opportunities for industrialized and industrializing states as well as
new challenges to the stability of the global economic system.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the causes and effects of the decline of
manufacturing in the West and the rise of low-cost producers in Asia. 
We will also study important international agreements that gradually
eased barriers to trade between nations.*
