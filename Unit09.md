**Unit 9: Alternative Models of Industrialization** <span
id="9"></span> 
**After the First World War, a revolutionary government in Russia tried
to create an alternative model to capitalist industrial development. 
The new Soviet Union accomplished massive industrial feats before and
during the Second World War but at enormous cost to the environment and
to Soviet citizens.  In China, a successful communist revolution ushered
in another experiment in socialist industrialization after 1949, first
along Soviet lines and then according to the plans of Mao Zedong.  After
the Second World War, leaders in India and other newly independent
states tried to find a “third way” of development, rejecting capitalism
as well as Soviet-style socialism as pathways to industrialization.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine alternative plans for industrial
development from the Soviet Union, China, and India.  We will analyze
the efficacy and costs of these different approaches, comparing them to
the model followed by capitalist states.**

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 9 hours and 30 minutes to
