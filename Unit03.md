**Unit 3: Capitalism, Agriculture, and Industry** <span id="3"></span> 
**Capitalism, an economic system based on the private ownership of
productive power, made the Industrial Revolution possible by creating
demands for goods and incentives for entrepreneurs to invest in
production.  Capitalism had its origins in merchant activity, but by the
17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, it began to penetrate
traditional agricultural and industrial sectors.  New crops from the
Americas and new ideas about agricultural production led to an
Agricultural Revolution in Europe, resulting in growing populations as
well as the creation of new wealth among landowners.  Capitalism matured
as an economic system in the Atlantic World, where investors used
capital to buy land in the Americas and captive labor from Africa to
produce consumer goods like tobacco, sugar, and cotton for growing world
markets.  Throughout the period, capitalist merchants tapped existing
handicraft producers of manufactured goods, using saved capital to
finance industrial production on a growing scale.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will analyze the impact of the Agricultural
Revolution on Europe and see how it encouraged the growth of capitalism
in Europe, across the Atlantic, and around the world.**
