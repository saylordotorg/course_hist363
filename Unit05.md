**Unit 5: The Social and Political Impact of Industrialization** <span
id="5"></span> 
**Industrialization was not merely a change in the way societies
produced goods.  It brought a transformation in the way people lived,
turning rural towns into urban manufacturing centers.  Newly
industrialized societies faced health problems and challenges to
conventional family and social structures.  Politics in industrialized
societies were transformed as traditional landed elites gave way to
industrial capitalists and the burgeoning “middle class” of businessmen
and professionals.  Workers also began to challenge traditional
political systems, drawing on new ideologies to suggest alternatives the
developing capitalist-industrial world in which they lived*  
    
 *In this unit, we will survey the sweeping changes that
industrialization brought to Europe and the rest of the world between
the late 18<sup>th</sup> and mid-19<sup>th</sup> centuries.  We will
then examine how working class and middle class individuals and
organizations used these changes to challenge traditional elites.**
