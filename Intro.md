Course Syllabus for "HIST363: Global Perspectives on Industrialization"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This course will focus on the emergence and evolution of industrial
societies around the world.  We will begin by comparing the legacies of
industry in ancient and early modern Europe and Asia and examining the
agricultural and commercial advances that laid the groundwork for the
Industrial Revolution of the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup>
centuries.  We will then follow the history of industrialization in
different parts of the world, taking a close look at the economic,
social, and environmental effects of industrialization.  The course is
organized chronologically and thematically.  Each unit will focus on key
developments in the history of industry as well as on representative
areas of the globe, using primary-source documents, secondary readings,
and multimedia resources to illustrate the dynamic nature of industrial
change.  By the end of the course, you will understand how
industrialization developed, spread across the globe, and shaped
everyday life in the modern era.

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST363: Global Perspectives on Industrialization.  Below,
please find general information on the course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer: Jonathan Robins and Andrew Ramey**  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of free
online materials; however, the course makes primary use of the following
materials:  
    
 -Dr. Steven Kreis’ “[The History
Guide](http://www.historyguide.org/)”  
 -Yale University: Dr. John Merriman’s “[European Civilization,
1648–1945 Lectures](http://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-202)”  
 -The Science Museum’s “[Making the Modern
World](http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/)”  
 -The PBS television program, “[Commanding
Heights](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/hi/story/index.html)”  
    
 **Requirements for completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
In addition to the assigned readings and lectures, you will need to
complete 10 Saylor Foundation assignments, 1 per unit, and the Saylor
Foundation’s HIST363 Final Exam.  Please note that while the 10
assignments will not be graded, the Final Exam will be graded and you
must score 70% or higher on it to pass the course.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** It will take you about 94 hours to complete the
entire course.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  You should
use these time advisories to plan out how you will proceed through the
course.  For example, Unit 1.3.2 on Karl Marx will take about 3 hours to
complete.  You should consider making sure you can set aside enough time
to complete each reading or subunit before you begin.  It helps to
regularly schedule blocks of time for this course, such as setting aside
a few hours every Tuesday and Thursday night.  If you can establish a
regular pattern of reading, you will proceed smoothly through the course
and be better able to retain what you have read.  If you can go through
roughly one unit a week, you will be on an excellent pace.
