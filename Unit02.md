**Unit 2: Ancient and Early Modern Industry** <span id="2"></span> 
**Industry did not begin with the Industrial Revolution. Ancient
societies produced consumer goods on a large scale, serving markets
spread over hundreds or even thousands of miles.   In ancient Rome,
India and China, large populations, centralized governments, and
well-connected international trading routes created vast markets for all
manner of goods, ranging from military and agricultural equipment to
textiles and home décor. Entrepreneurs seeking to profit from these
markets developed new techniques and new tools for mass production that
laid the groundwork for future industrial advances. Many of these
technological advances fell into disuse during the medieval period, but
entrepreneurs continued to develop new commercial practices to organize
and finance large-scale business.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine several important industries that
developed in *the ancient world, such as mining, metallurgy, and
textiles. *We will then see how merchant entrepreneurs developed the
tools and institutions that led to capitalism.**
