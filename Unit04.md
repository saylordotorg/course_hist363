**Unit 4: The Industrial Revolution in England** <span id="4"></span> 
**The Industrial Revolution began in England, which was by 1750 one of
the wealthiest capitalist states in the world.  The Industrial
Revolution began in England’s textile industry, which was struggling to
produce goods cheaper and faster for growing consumer markets. 
Businessmen and factory workers, rather than scientists, developed key
inventions that solved major bottlenecks in textile production.  As the
scale of production grew, the factory emerged as a centralized location
where wage laborers could work on machines and raw material provided by
capitalist entrepreneurs.  By the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, steam
power was adapted to power factory machinery, sparking an even bigger
surge in the size, speed, and productivity of industrial machines. 
Heavy industries like ironworking were also revolutionized by new ideas,
and new transportation technologies were developed to move products
farther and faster.*  
  
 *Growing businesses soon outstripped the financial abilities of
individuals and their families, leading to legal reforms that allowed
corporations to own and operate businesses.  While England initially
tried to protect its industrial technologies, the major ideas of the
Industrial Revolution quickly spread to continental Europe and North
America.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine the major ideas and events of the
Industrial Revolution, study the effects the Industrial Revolution had
on the economy of England, and see how the process of economic change
spread to other parts of the world.**

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**
