**Unit 7: Mass Production, the Labor Movement, and the Consumer
Society** <span id="7"></span> 
**In the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, a
so-called “Second Industrial Revolution” centered on electronics and
chemicals brought new changes to industrial production and everyday
life.  While the inventions and early successes of the first Industrial
Revolution were the work of small businessmen and individual
capitalists, the innovations of the second phase came out of large
business organizations.  Fierce competition among these companies led to
the consolidation of industries by monopoly firms or the creation of
cartels.  New ideas changed how people worked within these giant firms,
resulting in even greater improvements in the speed and efficiency of
production.  Workers reacted to these changes by forming political
associations, seeking bargaining power with large capitalists.  For all
classes, this period represented a transition to a mass society,
characterized by the large-scale marketing and distribution of products,
services, and ideas.  New machines and new media turned individuals
living in limited regions into consumers of products and information
from a vast national or international community.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine the institutional, political, and social
changes that came to industrialized societies in the 19<sup>th</sup> and
20<sup>th</sup> centuries.  **
