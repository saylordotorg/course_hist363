**Unit 6: Imperialism and Industrialization in Asia** <span
id="6"></span> 
**The Industrial Revolution came late to East Asia.  By many accounts,
China was more industrially developed than Western Europe before 1800,
but England and the rest of Western Europe soon surged ahead with the
aid of cheap coal, steam power, and the vast natural resources and
markets provided by the Americas.  Industrialized European states forced
their way into traditionally limited markets in both China and Japan
during the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, flooding both countries with
manufactured goods.  Chinese officials bitterly resisted European
imperial encroachments and lost a losing battle against economic and
military imperialism, and Japanese leaders only grudgingly granted
limited concessions to foreign interests.  While China buckled under the
weight of imperialism and domestic insurrection, Japan’s government
adopted the military and industrial technology of the West to build a
strong, centralized state.  By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century,
Japan was an industrialized, imperialistic power able to successfully
resist foreign pressure.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine the factors that contributed to two very
different outcomes in China and Japan as the forces of industrialization
began to affect them in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.**

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**
