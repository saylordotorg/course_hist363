**Unit 8: Economic Crisis and War in the 20th Century** <span
id="8"></span> 
**While the Industrial Revolution brought great prosperity to many parts
of the world, it also ushered in many new challenges.  In 1914, tensions
between capitalist powers spilled over into war, and the new weapons of
industrial age produced a horrific slaughter in Europe.  After the war,
industrial powers struggled to recover in a decade of economic highs and
lows.  The weak global economy collapsed in 1929, causing widespread
unemployment in industrialized societies.  The failure of the
international community to maintain prosperity and peace led to the
Second World War, which devastated Europe and Asia.  After the war, the
United States and its allies devised a new system for managing the
international economy, while the Soviet Union and its allies pulled new
satellite states into a socialist economic system.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine the effects of industrialization on war,
as well as the effects of war on industrialization.  We will also study
the economic crises of the 1920s and 1930s and compare different
recovery strategies.**
